# Prediction-of-insurance-of-a-smoker
DATA-SET DESCRIPTION : 
			The dataset describes about the insurance of a company based upon the given age and health of the customer . 

CATEGORICAL VARIABLES :
1)	Sex
2)	Children
3)	Smoker

CONTINUOUS VARIABLES :
1)	BMI
2)	Charges



 Training the model using 80% of the dataset and implementing an appropriate GLM model by taking the binomial family.
  
 

 Taking alpha = 0.05 and estimating the parameters of the model.
 
From the results, we can see that the estimated values are :
Intercept : -4.544
X1 : 1.030
X2 : 1.219

 
 

From the results we can see that the accurate result after running the Monte Carlo runs(1000) is 50.44% and based on this result we can say that our model is quite sufficient to predict the customer is a smoker .
